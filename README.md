# StartUpClassify

This application utilizes deep learining techniques to develop high accuracy classification models. It begins by importing the data that will be used for training the model. Next, it prepares the data accordingly to comply with skicit learn & tensorflow protocols. The system determines a number of input nerons wich can be edited if needed. Subesently, it runs a series of training rounds to improve the accuracy of he model. Additionally, the program provides alternative model options and saves them in seperate files for further use.
